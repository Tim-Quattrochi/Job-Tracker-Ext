## Description
This is a job tracker application that allows users to create an account, add jobs to their profile, and track the status of their job applications. Users can also add notes to each job application to keep track of important information. Working on making a chrome extension that will allow users to add jobs to their profile directly from the job posting as another feature of this application.
